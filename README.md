## Introduction

I originally started making this project with the intention of it being something that I just play with my friends and myself. We had been wanting to be able to play Monopoly Deal remotely for the better part of a decade now, so I made it since there wasn't any solution that appeased us. There seems to be a niche community that would also like to see this, so here it is. It's still very much in development and you very well could encounter bugs, issues, or missing features(namely, houses/hotels aren't in the game yet).

## How To Use

### Option 1: Installer (Windows only)

[Download the latest installer](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/releases/download/v0.6.4/Monopoly-Deal-Setup-0.6.4.exe) and install the game.

#### Running the Game

Run the client with the shortcut on your desktop(if you chose to create one), searching for "Monopoly Deal", or navigating to C:\Program Files\Monopoly Deal(or where you chose to install it) and running `Monopoly Deal.exe`. The client's data files are stored and can be found at `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Monopoly Deal`.

#### Hosting the Server

Navigate to C:\Program Files\Monopoly Deal(or where you chose to install it) and run `Start Server.bat`. From there, you can play by yourself with bots, or you may invite your friends to play by registering them and giving them your IP and their registered ID. However, to be able to have your friends join, you will need to port-forward or use a proxy like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). The default port is 27599, this may be changed in the config.txt file that is generated by the server. The server files can be found at `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Monopoly Deal\server`.

### Option 2: Jar Files (All Operating Systems)

[Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/) is required to run both the client and the server. Later versions of Java probably will not work.

#### Running the Game

[Download the latest client jar](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/releases) and run it with javaw.exe from your Java 8 installation. You will be asked if you want to store the client's data in the application data folder on your PC or in the same folder the jar is running in.

#### Hosting the Server

[Download the latest server jar](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/releases) and run it with java.exe from your Java 8 installation. This will generate data files in the same folder the jar is running in. From there, you can play by yourself with bots, or you may invite your friends to play by registering them and giving them your IP and their registered ID. However, to be able to have your friends join, you will need to port-forward or use a proxy like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). The default port is 27599, this may be changed in the config.txt file that is generated by the server.

### Useful Server Commands

- `registerplayer [Player Name]`: Registers a player with a random ID. You must give this ID to the person you intend to use it so that they may login.
- `listregisteredplayers`: Lists all currently registered players, showing their name, ID, and op status.
- `start`: Deal out 5 cards to all players and start the game.
- `reset`: Puts all the cards back in the deck.
- `op [Player UID]`: Give a player server operator permissions, allowing them to execute all commands that the console could right from the in-game chat(accessible with the `T` key). `deop` can be used to revoke these permissions from a player. Simply preface your chat message with a "/" to indicate you're executing a command in-game. Example: `/start`
- `addbot <Name>`: Add a bot into your game.
- `kick [Player ID]`: Remove a player or bot from the game and return all of their cards back to the deck.
- `stop`: Closes the server.

Additional undocumented commands may be seen by using the `help` command.

### Video Tutorial (Outdated)

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaBYbJwyJLY) explaining how to get the basic functionality setup for the client/server. Credit to [Zyga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMOaG7Eqq1jr1-i8m48fMw) for kindly creating the video.

## Modding Support

If you're a developer, you can create mods for the server. You can find the guide [here](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/wiki/Modding-Guide).

There's a ton of custom cards I made that I'll probably release as a mod at some point.
