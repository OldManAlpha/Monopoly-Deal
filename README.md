## Introduction

I originally started making this project with the intention of it being something that I just play with my friends and myself. We had been wanting to be able to play Monopoly Deal remotely for the better part of a decade now, so I made it since there wasn't any solution that appeased us. There seems to be a niche community that would also like to see this, so here it is. I've made it barely functional enough to release it.

## Massive Disclaimers

This project is far from polished or even feature complete. All cards from the base game have been implemented **except** houses/hotels. They're low priority as they are usually as good as money in our house rules(extra money cards are added to the deck to compensate). Speaking of house rules, this game uses my house rules which will almost certainly differ from how you play. Rule customization is something I very much want to implement in the future. You'll probably encounter a few UI bugs, especially if you scale the the UI up/down. If there's a UI bug that prevents you from taking action, restarting your client will likely fix it. There's many ways the server can crash when misusing certain commands, so be cautious if you value the game you're currently playing.

## How To Use

### Prerequisites

[Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/) is required to run both the client and the server. Later versions of Java may or may not work.

Operating the server will require a little bit of technical knowhow. If you are hosting the server, you will need to port-forward or use a proxy like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). The default port is 27599, this may be changed in the config.txt file that is generated by the server.

### Server Setup

1. [Download the latest server version](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/releases) and put the .exe or .jar file in its own folder(it will generate files inside the same folder it's in).
2. The server will generate a few files on its first run, including the config.txt, which you can edit to change the server port.
3. Add users in the console by typing `registerplayer [Player Name]`. A randomly generated ID will be given and that is what the user will use to login with. View all your registered players with `listregisteredplayers`.
4. After all the desired players have connected, you start the game with the `start` command.
5. When the game finishes or you just want to restart, you can use the `reset` command to put all the cards back in the deck.

#### Useful Commands

- `op [Player UID]`: Give a player server operator permissions, allowing them to execute all commands that the console could right from the in-game chat(accessible with the `T` key). `deop` can be used to revoke these permissions from a player. Simply preface your chat message with a "/" to indicate you're executing a command in-game. Example: `/start`
- `kick [Player ID]`: Remove a player from the game and return all of their cards back to the deck.
- `transfercard [Card ID] [Collection ID] <Index> <Speed>`: Manually move a card to a destination. Card IDs and Collection IDs are visible when debug mode is enabled.
- `stop`: Closes the server.

Additional undocumented commands may be seen by using the `help` command.

### Client Setup

1. [Download the latest client version](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/releases)
2. Run the client .exe or .jar and decide whether you want the game data to be stored in the application data folder or where you're running the game from(former is recommended unless you know what you're doing)
3. Connect to the host's server with [their IPv4 address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and forwarded port(Example: `12.345.67.89:27599` or if you're the host, `localhost:27599`).
4. Input the User ID the host has assigned to you.
5. Connect and play.

**Note:** The .exe versions of the game are more than likely to trigger antiviruses. Either make an exception for the file or use the .jar version instead.

### Video Tutorial (Slightly Outdated)

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaBYbJwyJLY) explaining how to get the basic functionality setup for the client/server. Credit to [Zyga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMOaG7Eqq1jr1-i8m48fMw) for kindly creating the video.

## Modding Support

If you're a developer, you can create mods for the server. You can find the guide [here](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal/wiki/Modding-Guide).

There's a ton of custom cards I made that I'll probably release as a mod at some point.

## To-do

- [ ] Implement Houses/Hotels [Planned for v0.7]
- [ ] Implement customizable decks [Planned for v0.7]
- [ ] Allow for the customization of game rules [Planned for v0.7]
- [ ] Implement action cards from other editions
- [ ] Better document server commands
- [ ] Server UI?
- [ ] Implement Monopoly Bid mode
